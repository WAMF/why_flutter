# Flutter Presentation Viewer - Usage Guide

## Overview

You now have a complete presentation viewer app with:

✅ **Home Screen** with file picker and drag & drop support  
✅ **JSON Presentation Format** - Current presentation exported as `why_flutter_presentation.json`  
✅ **Go Router Navigation** with URL parameter support  
✅ **Auto-navigation to Home** after last slide  
✅ **Cross-platform Support** (mobile, desktop, web)  

## Quick Start

1. **Run the app**: `flutter run`
2. **Load a presentation**: 
   - Click "Browse Files" to select a JSON file
   - Drag & drop a JSON file onto the drop zone
   - Click "Load Default Presentation" for the built-in demo
3. **Navigate**: Use Space/Arrow keys or touch controls
4. **Return to home**: Press Space on the last slide

## URL-Based Loading

Load presentations directly from URLs by navigating to:
```
/presentation/[URL-encoded-json-url]
```

Example:
```
https://yourapp.com/#/presentation/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fuser%2Frepo%2Fmain%2Fpresentation.json
```

## File Format

The exported `why_flutter_presentation.json` shows the complete format. Key features:
- Multiple slide types (title, statistics, performance, etc.)
- Speaking notes for each slide
- Source links with descriptions
- Statistics and bullet points
- Timestamps and metadata

### Navigation (`lib/main.dart`)
- Go Router with 3 routes: `/`, `/presentation`, `/presentation/:url`

### Presentation Viewer (`lib/widgets/slideshow_screen.dart`)  
- Accepts `Presentation` object parameter
- Auto-starts presentation (no start screen)
- Returns to home after last slide
- Maintains all original features (notes, save/load, etc.)

### JSON Export
- `why_flutter_presentation.json` contains the full presentation

## Testing

The app includes drag & drop support, file loading, and URL parameters. Test with:
1. Local JSON files via file picker
2. Drag & drop (desktop/web)  
3. URL loading: `/presentation/[encoded-url]`
4. Keyboard navigation through to the end (returns to home)
